/**
 * A service that handles artifact resolution and caching.
 *
 * <p>The basic types of artifact are:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Flat URL file</li>
 *     <li>Maven-style (has metadata attached)</li>
 *     <li>Minecraft version (has metadata attached in the form of its {@link VersionDescriptor.Full})</li>
 *     <li>Deserialized JSON object via a URL (or file) endpoint</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Caching</h2>
 * <p>Caches can resolve any sort of artifact. They support a parent cache.
 * To be safe for use across multiple processes, caches will be write-locked
 * while a single process is performing its writes.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Resolution</h2>
 * <p>Artifacts are resolved in several stages. These are:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>(optional) Resolve metadata. Metadata is an artifact type like any other.</li>
 *     <li>(optional) Resolve dependencies</li>
 * </ol>
